# JuMBOs

Code using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looking at the survivability of already established JuMBOs in clusters after 1 Myr of simulation time.
Investigates different parameter space, including Plummer and Fractal cluster distributions (choice between Rvir = 0.5pc and 1.0pc), existence of Jupiter-mass freefloaters or not and the number of stars.

- data/: Hosts output simulation files and rudimentary statistics of current observations
- plotters/: Scripts for data reduction and plotting
- src/: Scripts needed for simulation runs
- latex_files/: Text files and plots for final report.
